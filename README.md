####  MIOP  #### 

MIOP was developed as a semster project. I personally wrote all the code, but together with a team of 4 other biomedical engineerers we made UML diagrams to show how the program was intended to work. In the documentation for this program is an analysis of the field of Sepsis, why it's an issue and how a clinical decision support system can help. The documentation alse include an analysis, a design and a description of the implementation. In the analysis and design UML and MVC was used. 

MIOP was my first project with Java and Gradle.
It's fully functional with a UI made with JavaFX. To help make the UI I used SceneBuilder.
